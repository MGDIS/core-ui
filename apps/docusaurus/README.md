# Docusaurus

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is used to create the Core UI documentation website.

## Build

The website is built by importing the root and the packages markdown files.

The [import-docs.sh](../../scripts/import-docs.sh) script is responsible for importing those files during the release pipeline.
