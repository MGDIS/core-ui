## Introduction

**MG Components** is a reusable component library designed to help MGDIS developers build user interfaces more efficiently. It provides a collection of modular, framework-agnostic UI components that are easy to use, accessible, and customizable. The library is built following the **Atomic Design** methodology, which organizes components into small, reusable building blocks.

Components in MG Components are developed using [StencilJS](https://stenciljs.com/), a compiler for creating fast, standards-based Web Components. This ensures compatibility with all modern browsers and seamless integration with any framework (e.g., AngularJS, Vue, etc) or even without a framework. The library also leverages [StorybookJS](https://storybook.js.org/) for component documentation and testing.

## Key Features

- **Reusable Components**: Modular and framework-agnostic, designed for flexibility and scalability.
- **Accessibility**: Built with WAI-ARIA standards to ensure inclusive user experiences.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to your design system using CSS variables.
- **Cross-Framework Compatibility**: Works with AngularJS, Vue, or no framework at all.

## Atomic Design

MG Components follows the **Atomic Design** methodology, which divides UI components into hierarchical levels:

- **Atoms**: Basic building blocks (e.g., buttons, icons).
- **Molecules**: Groups of atoms working together (e.g., input fields, menus).

<!-- Not for now
- **Organisms**: Complex structures composed of molecules and atoms (e.g., navigation bars, tables).
- **Templates**: Page-level layouts defining structure and content hierarchy.
- **Pages**: Final implementations of templates with real content.
